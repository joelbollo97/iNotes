# iNotes
Simple iOS App to create and store notes

iNotes is a simple application for iOS, created to have a better understanding of how some of the main components of iOS Programming work:
- Buttons
- Labels
- Navigation Controller
- Table Views
- Text Views
- Search Controllers
- Core Data
- Delegates

Navigation controller is used for navigating through views more flexibly. The first view consists of a table view that contains a list 
of created notes. Notes are stored as objects using CoreData and each note has a title, date of creation and content. In this view you 
can add, select or delete notes. 
The second view consists of the note content and title, which can be changed both in the current view. The content is written inside a
text view and the user can either save the changes made to the content or cancel them by using two buttons, "Save" and "Cancel".
